# Medibot
IBM - 312 project

Our project involves building a disease predictor bot which can effectively diagnose an illness based on a user's description of his symptoms. 
The bot reads the user's description of their symptoms and uses NLP to retrieve relevant information. 
Then, logistic regression, Support Vector Machine and Artificial Neural network models which have been trained on a dataset of diseases and their associated symptom description are used to predict the disease that most closely matches the user's symptoms. 
The result is returned along with some suggested steps.
A GUI built using the Tkinter library is used to display the results.
